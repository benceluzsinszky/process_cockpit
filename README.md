# process_cockpit

A Python application that let's me access production data easily.

Samples are included.

Very limited version, for security reasons.


I needed to ditribute this application between my coworkers, so I created a .exe from the code.
Because of this, I could not use pandas as it takes up a lot of space, so data handling was done manually.
